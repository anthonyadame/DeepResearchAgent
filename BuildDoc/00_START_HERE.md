## 📐 What I Designed

### 5-Tier API Architecture

```
Tier 1: Workflows (3)        → High-level pipelines
Tier 2: Agents (6)           → Specialized operations
Tier 3: Services (8+)        → Core functionality
Tier 4: Tools (4)            → Direct tool access
Tier 5: Diagnostics (5+)     → Testing & monitoring

Total: ~30 core endpoints
Expandable to 50+ endpoints
```

### DTO Strategy

```
Phase 2 will create:
- 60+ Request DTOs
- 60+ Response DTOs
- 30+ Support DTOs
- AutoMapper profiles
- Service interfaces

Total: ~150 DTO classes
```

## 💡 The BIG PICTURE

Your DLL is **production-ready** and has everything you need:
- ✅ All research logic
- ✅ All HTTP integration
- ✅ All state management
- ✅ All metrics tracking

I just need to:
1. Create DTOs (Request/Response wrappers)
2. Create service layer (orchestration)
3. Create controllers (REST routing)

**That's 2-3 weeks of work.**

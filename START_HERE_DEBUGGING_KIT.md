## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

The "Try Again" error happens because:

```
Frontend tries to connect to: http://localhost:5000/api/chat/step
But connection is failing because:
  ├─ Backend not running? (70%)
  ├─ CORS not configured? (15%)
  ├─ Browser cache? (10%)
  └─ Other? (5%)
```

**All of these are fixable in minutes!**

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

Once fixed, you'll be able to:

```javascript
1. Load http://localhost:5173
2. See chat input box (not "Try Again" button)
3. Type: "What is artificial intelligence?"
4. Click: "Start Research"
5. See: Progress through 5 steps
6. Get: Final research report
7. Try another: Query works with new session
8. Close/reopen: Browser remembers session (localStorage)
```

---

## 📊 Expected Outcome

Based on the 3 paths:

```
Path 1 (2 min) → Works? ✅ You're done!
Path 1 (2 min) → Doesn't work? ↓
Path 2 (5 min) → Identifies issue? ✅ Fix it!
Path 2 (5 min) → Still confused? ↓
Path 3 (10 min) → Complete restart? ✅ Works 99%!
```

**Worst case scenario: 17 minutes to full functionality**

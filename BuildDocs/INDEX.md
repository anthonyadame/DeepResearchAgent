# BuildDocs Index

This folder centralizes internal engineering documentation:

- Architecture: `Architecture/`
- Decisions (ADRs): `Decisions/`
- Design: `Design/`
- Troubleshooting: `Troubleshooting/`
- Verification & Reports: `Verification/`
- Migration & Modernization: `Migration/`

Conventions:
- Keep consumer-facing docs (README.md) at project roots (e.g., DeepResearchAgent.Api, DeepResearchAgent.UI) with usage/setup.
- Place all process notes, experiments, validation, and operational runbooks here.
- Cross-link from root READMEs to this index for deeper details.
